Quickly bulk-create pages with optional SEO metadata, improving content creation workflow in the WordPress admin.

== Description ==

**Auto Page Creator** is a powerful and user-friendly WordPress plugin that allows you to automatically create multiple default pages from the admin panel with just a few clicks. It's designed to save developers time when building websites by quickly creating essential pages like "Home," "About Us," "Contact," and more.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `auto-page-creator` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install the plugin via the WordPress plugin directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Once activated, go to the **Pages** section and you’ll see a new submenu called **Auto Page Creator**.
4. Configure the number of pages to create (up to 100), and click "Create Pages" to generate the default pages.
